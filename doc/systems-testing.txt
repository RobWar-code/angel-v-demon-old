Angel v Demon

Systems Test Outline

The general procedures are as follows
1. Check the start-up texts
2. Check all input points (see the section Logic Analysis in 
    project-analysis.txt these are numbered "Inn" on the flow-chart)
2a. Ensure input prompt is clearly understandable
2b. Check response to garbage input
2c. Check input validation
2d. Check for availability of the quit option
2e. Check that the logic flows correctly from the inputs
3. Check randomly selected branch points (see the section Logic Analysis in
    project-analysis.txt, these are numbered "Rnn" on the flow-chart)

Ensure that the game is feasible for players, adjust accordingly.
